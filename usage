Hello,this is an script which is automatized.
When you install the script,you need to write chmod +x *(on the directory you installed the script)
This script is translated in romanian.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you first you run the script,it will tell you "baga aipi sa faci skan cu nmap" winch means, write an ip to start the nmap 
After you write the ip to run the nmap scan,it will ask you for the [sudo] passowrd for $yourusername
After all of this,the nmap will it start.
When it is done,you will get an 2 file ,with output from nmap scan on the TARGET
